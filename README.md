### Hi there, I'm Temi ðŸ‘‹

I'm a full-stack software engineer with a passion for building high-quality, highly scalable software applications. Nothing excites me more than using technologies to solve people's needs. 

When I'm not working on a project, then I'm probably on youtube, either watching a programming tutorial or short movies and music videos. And if I'm not doing any of those, then I'm probably out with my friends. otherwise, I'm on my bed sleeping for sure!

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on building the next generation of African software engineers through the [Google Africa Developers' Scholarship Program](https://gads.andela.com/)  
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on Open Source Projects
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with Getting a software engineering position at an exciting startup company. 
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Python, Javascript, React, Node
